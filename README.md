# Cave Story Online
Archives of these files seem to be very scattered online. I've attempted to restore as it once was, but I no longer have the original files.
As well, some of the files seem to have been modified and I'm not sure which stages originally came with my official releases.

I did not create Cave Story Online Edit, I have not been in contact with the person who created it in over 4 years, and I thouroughly believe the source code to it is forever lost.

The Cave Story Online servers (cave.cf) went offline 4 years ago. I did not host or operate it, and I have not been in contact with the person who did in over 4 years.

This project is completely unrelated to Cave Story Engine 2 and the Cave Story source code. This predates my decompilation efforts.
